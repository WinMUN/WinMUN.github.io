        <h2> OAS </h2>
        <p> The popular narrative regarding erecting a wall on the Mexican-American border has established a myth suggesting vast illegal Mexican immigration into the United States. However, that number has declined and more Americans are in fact entering Mexico than vice versa. The real problem is the dangerous and long journey central Americans from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala embark on to reach the United States by travelling through Mexico on route to U.S. Designated the Northern Triangle, the trio of Central American countries have faced increasing instability in the past decade due to insecurity arising from a brutal war between criminal organizations and security forces that has prompted mass Northern Migration.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Organization of American States specialized general assembly will specifically look at the history, current issues and contemporary policy proposals to fight instability and crime in the Northern Triangle. Delegates will be exposed to the embedded problems within these three countries’ societies, the plethora of difficulties migrants experience on their expedition as well as diplomatic roadblocks countries face when attempting to cooperate. Delegates should understand that this topic is multi-faceted, with many variables that are constantly changing.
          <br>
          <br>
          To adequately prepare for this committee, all delegates should read the background guide thoroughly. It is strongly suggested that each delegate research extensively the history of these countries, the advancement of drug cartels, problems migrants face as well as the various recent policies regional actors have brought forward thus far. While each delegate will be given a brief outline of their selected country’s position and involvement in the migration crisis of the Northern Triangle, it is merely a starting point. The chair and vice chair are highly motivated to provide a challenging and engaging experience for all delegates. See you soon! </p>

        <h2> UNSCO </h2>
        <p>On September 11, 2001, the United States experienced what has been deemed the worst terrorist attack in world history.  Four LA bound planes were hijacked and flown into the World Trade Centre buildings, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. Casualties were unfathomable: over 2,800 had died and almost 9,000 were injured. The world watched as one of the most powerful countries on the planet was infiltrated by 19 Al-Queda militants posing as travellers on national commercial planes. This event shook the international system to its core and reshaped international relations and United States’ national security as we know it. The United Nations Security Council met on September 12th, 2001 for its 4370th meeting in order to assess the situation and form a resolution. We will be simulating this meeting in an attempt to form a plausible and effective resolution based on the happenings of the previous day. Discussion will include the details of air threats and security immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as each country’s position on the topics, Aerial Terrorism and International Border Security. This committee will be introduced historically, however it will take on the format of a post hoc crisis committee. This will be the first time the UNSC has met since the 9/11 attacks. The international community is in turmoil and is scrambling for a Security Council decision. It is up to you to establish a course of action in accordance with the events that have occurred - We look forward to hearing your solutions.

        <h2> Crisis </h2>
        <p> 	Drastic changes were happening within Russia in 1917. The Great War has strained the Motherland of its industry and economy, with no end date in sight. With a hungry, politicized and armed population, two revolutions have taken place. While the February Revolution ended the Russian Empire and forced the Tzar into abdication, the subsequent Provisional Government experienced troubles cooperating with the Bolsheviks.  Dissatisfied with the Provisional Government’s continued interest in the Great War and the sharing of power, the Bolsheviks initiated the October Revolution. The October Revolution cast the Provisional Government out of Moscow, and a civil war quickly ensued.
          <br>
          <br>
          This Joint-Crisis Committee of the Russian Civil War will place delegates in the shoes of Russian generals and politicians of the Red forces, the White forces, and the many more factions involved in the civil war. While the Red forces of communists united under the Bolshevik flag, the opposing White forces composed of everyone opposed to the communists (monarchists, republicans, liberals, democratic reformists, etc.). This gives the delegates the unique opportunity to explore the needs and wants of the different factions vying for power of Mother Russia.
          <br>
          <br>
          Delegates will be divided into two separate rooms to simulate the Red vs. White dynamics of the civil war. Personal background guides will be provided for each delegate, to inform everyone of their personal jurisdictions, political powers and weaknesses. That said, each delegate should still research the general history of the Russian Civil War, as to familiarize themselves with the historical context. The Dias and Crisis staff are dedicated to making WinMUN’s first ever Joint-Crisis Committee the most stimulating committee of this year’s High School Conference. Hope to see you all there!</p>
