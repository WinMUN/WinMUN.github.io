          <img src="../resources/arianne.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
          <p> Arianne is a 4th year International Relations and Developmental Studies student with a passion for Latin American politics and studying intergovernmental organizations. Originally she is from Montreal, Quebec but her family is from Venezuela.  Her passions include baseball and travelling and she has now been on two short term study abroad trips and also a semester on exchange in Santiago de Chile. She was part of WinMUN’s first secretariat when the organization started in August 2014 and has been in love with all things Model UN ever since. Though this is the 3rd high school conference she has been a part of organizing, this will be the first time she is in the country to attend the day of and so she is very excited to share those two days with her staff and the incoming delegates. </p>

          <p>Jason is currently the Director General of WinMUN. He is a third-year International Relations student, with concentration in Economics and History. Jason joined WinMUN during his first year attending the University of Windsor. Prior to that, he was an awkward high schooler with little involvement in school clubs and zero social skills. With the weekly simulations and the conferences Jason has been to in the past two years, he has gradually built up his analytical skills and the confidence to speak publicly regarding issues he is passionate about. His favorite aspect regarding MUN is the opportunity to travel. Jason has been to conferences such as RMCMUN, UWMG20, McMUN, and MUN4UN. These conferences gave him the opportunities to travel to many places he otherwise would not have traveled to, most notably Montreal and the UN Headquarters in NYC. Outside of school, Jason is an enthusiastic model builder and Star Wars fan. Most would argue that he is too nerdy for his own good.  </p>

          <p>Sarah Hage-Hassan has joined WinMUN the summer before her first year of university as the Director of Events. She joined because she has always had a deep interest for politics and international conflict in general. A few conferences, simulations and a year later she became the Chief of Staff for WinMUN, and has worked on some very important projects. MUN has taught Sarah that everyone, based on their upbringing, their culture, religion or ethnicity may have different opinions and views than you that are all somehow valid. MUN has taught she how to engage in debates on different topics by taking perspectives that I would not necessarily have in real life. MUN has helped Sarah form solid opinions about many political topics and has helped her grow into a position of leadership. Sarah is a Political Science major, with two minors: Philosophy and French. Her interests include debating, running and traveling. </p>
